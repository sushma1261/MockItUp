Features needed for MVP and the task breakdown:

1. Ability to integrate with any free ai service and do basic prompt engineering.
2. Move some hard coded data to cloud
3. Integrate with GAuth or any authentication tool
4. Video/Audios uploaded should be saved in cloud instead of local
5. Feedback should come via prompt engineering. It shouldn't be hard-coded.
6. Ability to add custom questions
7. Ability to sort/filter the questions based on popularity etc.

Mapping between features and value(s) to be delivered by your app:

1. All the above 1-5 are values. Since we would need to have these in the app for the success criteria of the app.
2. 6 and 7 are good to have and hence can be grouped into features.
